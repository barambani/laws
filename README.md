Laws is a set of sample implementations of the fundamental functional programming abstractions, with the sole purpouse of showing the definition and the property-based verification of their algebraic structure's laws. They are implemented here as type classes for types of kind `*` and for higher order type operators of kind `* -> *` and, given the exemplificative nature of this work, they are strictly limited to the most basic, but still most important, ones. To notice that the implementations in this repository are not meant to be used in production code and, by no means, are intended as a state of the art in library design and modules composition. In more than one case, on the contrary, the semantic cohesion, the ease of understanding and the clarity, as reduction of boilerplate code, have been preferred to optimization and usability. For real life collections of production-ready functional programming abstractions, the suggestion is to have a look at libraries like [Scalaz](https://github.com/scalaz/scalaz) or [Cats](https://github.com/typelevel/cats).

## Code Structure
Currently the project includes the following structures
- [Semigroup](#semigroup)
- [Monoid](#monoid)
- [Covariant Functor (Functor)](#covariant-functor-functor)
- [Contravariant Functor (Contravariant)](#contravariant-functor-contravariant)
- [Invariant Functor (Invariant)](#invariant-functor-invariant)
- [Cartesian](#cartesian) (*)
- [Applicative Functor (Applicative)](#applicative-functor-applicative)
- [Monad](#monad)

(*) No laws abided by

Each structure lives in its own **_Scala_** file called **_Module_** and every module provides

```
- the type definition
- a set of instances
- a syntax extension
- a definition of the laws using the syntax extensions
- a definition of the laws using the structure's primitives (for quick comparison)
```

An extra file with the supporting **_Algebra_** completes the project. The structure of the source code, as can be seen, is very linear and easy to navigate so, for further details, the best advise is to [look into the the code itself](https://github.com/barambani/laws/tree/master/src/main/scala).

## Structures
### Semigroup
A *semigroup* consists of a *set* `A` (*type for us from now on*) and a binary operation `combine`. A possible way to represent it in Scala is
```scala
trait Semigroup[A] {
  def combine: (A, A) => A
}
```
For the algebra (the *type* `A` and its operations) to be a valid *semigroup* `combine` has to abide by the associativity law for every `a1`, `a2` and `a3` in `A`
```scala
(a1: A, a2: A, a3: A) => (a1 <> a2) <> a3 == a1 <> (a2 <> a3)

```
*Notice that the syntax extension allows us to use the more compact notation `<>` for `combine`. The right hand side of the expression above, in fact, is the actual body of the law definition in the code itself (see below)*
```scala
trait SemigroupLaws[A] {

  implicit def F: Semigroup[A]

  def combineAssociativity(a1: A, a2: A, a3: A): Boolean =
    (a1 <> a2) <> a3 == a1 <> (a2 <> a3)
}
```

### Monoid
A *monoid* is a specialization of a *semigroup*. To be a *monoid* any *semigroup* needs to define also an identity element for the `combine` operation. With that we mean an element in the *type* `A` that, when combined with any other element in `A` trhough the `combine` operation, results in the other element itself. It can be called `empty` and a possible implementation is
```scala
trait Monoid[A] extends Semigroup[A] {
  val empty: A
}
```
where, as per its own definition, it has to satisfy the identity law for every `a` in `A`
```scala
(a: A) => (a <> empty) == a && (empty <> a) == a
```
*Worth nothing that in the actual implementation of the law, we had to go through the implicit handle for the instance in use to access the `Monoid[A]` `empty` element. This is not present in the expression above just to keep the read more fluent*. The real implementation of the law is in fact
```scala
sealed trait MonoidLaws[A] extends SemigroupLaws[A] {

  implicit def F: Monoid[A]

  def emptyIdentity(a: A): Boolean =
    (a <> F.empty) == a && (F.empty <> a) == a
}
```

### Covariant Functor (Functor)
A *covariant functor* or *functor* is an abstract data type that has the capability for its vaules to be mapped over. More specifically, given a *functor* `fa` it's possible to obtain another *functor* `fb` with the same structure as `fa`, through the application of a *function* `f: a -> b` to every element in `fa`. It's worth noting that this is the first type class we meet that abstracts over an *higher order type operator* (or *type constructor*) and not over a *type*. This is because *functor* is an abstraction for *type constructor* (in this case *first order kinded types* or types of kind `* -> *`) and not for regural types (or types of kind `*`). In Scala we can represent it as
```scala
trait Functor[F[_]] {
  def map[A, B]: F[A] => (A => B) => F[B]
    
  def lift[A, B]: (A => B) => F[A] => F[B] =
    f => fa => map(fa)(f)
}
```
Notice that another function `lift[A, B]` can be derived from `map` (`lift` is actually what's called `fmap` in Haskell). It better describes another capability that can be provided by a *functor*. It allows, in fact, to create a morphism from a function from `A` to `B` to a function from `F[A]` to `F[B]`, that is the same as saying that it allows to *lift* a function on *types* to a function on *type constructors* `F[_]`.

For an instance of `Functor[F[_]]` to be a valid *functor*, the `map` operation must preserve the identity morphism for every `F[A]` in `A` and the composition of morphisms for every `F[A]` in `A` and every `f` from `A` => `B` and `g` from `B` => `C`
```scala
(fa: F[A]) => (fa map identity[A]) == fa
(fa: F[A], f: A => B, g: B => C) => (fa map (g compose f)) == (fa map f map g)
```

### Contravariant Functor (Contravariant)
To understand what a *contravariant functor* is let's focus on the adaptive semantic of the *functor* clearly visible in its *Function1* instance below.
```scala
implicit def functionFunctor[X]: Functor[X -> ?] =
  new Functor[X -> ?] {
    def map[A, B]: (X -> A) => (A => B) => (X -> B) =
      fa => f => Func(f compose fa)
  }
```
We can see that it allows to transform the **output** type inside the context *Function1* composing an `A => B` to the function application `fa.apply`. Reasoning along the same line, we could argue that we might also want to adapt the **input** type of another *Function1* where we fix the output and that can be defined as `? -> Y`. In this case we cannot `map` the input type otherwise we wouldn't be able to apply the *Function1* anymore. `map` clearly cannot do that. The types don't align. What we can do instead, is to prepend a *morphism* to *Function1* that would give us exactly the type we need in **input** still remaining inside the context *Function1*. This is exactly what a *contravariant functor* is designed to do with its `contramap`. Let's have a look at a possible instance
```scala
implicit def functionContravariant[Y]: Contravariant[? -> Y] =
  new Contravariant[? -> Y] {
    def contramap[A, B]: (B -> Y) => (A => B) => (A -> Y) =
      fb => f => Func(fb compose f)
  }
```
The reader might observe that satisfying just this very specific need wouldn't be worth the troubles of an abstraction formalization and that's an absolutely reasonable objection. *Contravariant functor* actually doesn't work only in this particular scenario. On the contrary its peculiarity is that it generalizes this behavior and applies the adaptation to any other context that models a form of processing. That is the same as saying that we can have this feature for any *higher order type operator* for which we can define a `contramap[A, B]`. As an example, let's consider a `Show[B]` abstraction defined as
```scala
trait Show[B] {
  def show: B => String
}
```
that converts to string a type `B`. A *contravariant functor* for `Show` can adapt the `show` function to accept any other type in **input** as long as we can provide a *morphism* from this other type to `B`. It can do that because we implemented a valid `contramap` for `Show` that can generate a `Show[A]` given an `A => B` withiout even providing the implementation for `show: A => String`. All we have to do is use the `contramap` function like in the example below making sure all the types are in line.
```scala
val fb: Show[B] = Show[B]
val f: A => B = ???

// this gives us a working instance of Show[A] fully implemented
val fa: Show[A] = fb contramap f

val anA: A = ???
fa.show(anA) // Works fine
```
The *contravariant functor type class* can be defined as
```scala
trait Contravariant[F[_]] {
  def contramap[A, B]: F[B] => (A => B) => F[A]
  
  def lift[A, B]: (A => B) => F[B] => F[A] =
    f => fb => contramap(fb)(f)
}
```
A valid instance of this *type class* needs to abide by the following laws (that are actually dual to the *functor*'s laws)
```scala
(fa: F[A]) => (fa contramap identity[A]) == fa
(fc: F[C], f: A => B, g: B => C) => (fc contramap (g compose f)) == (fc contramap g contramap f)
```
Observe that also *contravariant functor* provides a function `lift[A, B]` (that's actually what's called `contramap` in Haskell). It can be simply seen, like in the case of *functor*, as a way to lift a function into a context, but in an inverted way.
